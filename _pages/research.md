I research about how to improve Software Engineering using empirical methods and Evidence-Based Software Engineering. This page provides possible research topics (for BS, MS, or PhD level). Students interested in working with me might be able to think possible solutions to one of these problems. **English skills is required for any of them (reading at least).**

1. Mining Software Repositories of COVID-19
**Questions:** How common are dual-license software? Why developers use two+ licenses?
**Skills:** script programming (e.g., Python, Lua, Ruby, etc)
**Related Work**: [MSR'18](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/msr2018b.pdf)

1. Understanding Students Behavior in Open-Source Communities<br>
**Questions:** What kind of contributors are made by students? Are they working for some classroom projects? summer job? hackathons?<br>
**Skills:** script programming (e.g., Python, Lua, Ruby, etc)<br>
**Related work**: [CSEET'17](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/cseet2017.pdf)
